  abstract = {Searching and exploring online information is fundamental for our society. However, it is common to find inaccurate information on the Internet, that can quickly spread and be hard to identify. Fortunately, today, many fact-checking sources verify online information to provide online users with a means to recognize its truthfulness. These sources use different languages and scoring systems, which makes fact validation challenging and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a new release of ClaimsKG, a knowledge graph of about 59,580 claims, which covers 13 different fact-checking sources and provides a structured way to retrieve verified online claims. ClaimsKG is built using a pipeline that makes use of entity linking and disambiguation tools to fetch entities from DBpedia and an ad-hoc scoring normalization system. ClaimsKG is used as a showcase to provide the public with interesting and verified information about events of our times.},
